A local dataset, named KPK-waters, has been meticulously extracted from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite missions of the European Union, focusing on the geographical areas of Nowshera and Charsadda. These regions were chosen due to their susceptibility to annual floods, with Nowshera experiencing recurrent flooding and Charsadda being a convergence point for the Swat and Kabul rivers, contributing to flooding in the surrounding areas. Satellite imagery spanning the last five years, divided into quarterly intervals, was acquired.
Notably, the dataset exhibits a significant enhancement by incorporating 12-band TIFF format image files, surpassing the conventional use of only RGB JPEG files. Covering a geographical expanse of 300 square km, each satellite image, obtained from a height of up to 500 m with a resolution of 10 m, is meticulously processed. The raw images, sized at 2500 x 2500 pixels, from four locations within the study area, are further cropped into 128 x 128 pixel input images. This meticulous curation results in the KPK-waters dataset comprising 22,888 images. For organizational purposes, the dataset is classified into training, testing, and validation subsets, encompassing 16,021, 4,578, and 2,289 images, respectively. This rich dataset serves as a valuable resource
